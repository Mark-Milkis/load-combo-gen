# load_groups.yml
#
# This YAML file defines the load groups for various load combinations used in structural analysis.
# Each load group is represented as a key, with the corresponding load cases or sub-groups as nested keys.
#
# Example:
# Dead:     # Load group for dead loads, as all dead loads are applied together, subgroups are not defined
#   - DL    # Each entry is a load case
#   - SDL
#
# Live:    # Load group for live loads, as live loads are applied in different ways, subgroups are defined
#   Perm:  # Subgroup for permanent live loads, load cases defined in this subgroup will not be combined with other subgroups
#     - LL
#   Construction:
#     - LL_Construction
#   Pattern:
#     - LL_Pattern
#
# Wind:
#   North:
#     - WL_Frame_North
#     - WL_Cladding_North
#   West:
#     - WL_Frame_West
#     - WL_Cladding_West
#
# Seismic:
#   North:
#     - EQ_North
#   West:
#     - EQ_West
#
# Lateral:
#   Wind:
#     - Wind  # References the Wind load group
#   Seismic:
#     - Seismic  # References the Seismic load group
#
# The load groups are used in the main.py script to generate load combinations for structural analysis.
