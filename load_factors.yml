# load_factors.yml
#
# This YAML file defines the load factors for various load combinations used in structural analysis.
# Each load combination is represented as a key, with the corresponding load factors as nested keys.
#
# Example:
# LRFD1:
#   Dead: 1.4
#   Soil: 1.4 # Unreferenced load groups will not be used
#
# LRFD2:
#   Dead: 1.2 # Load factor can be applied to the whole group
#   Live:
#     Perm: 1.6 # Load factor can be applied to a specific subgroup
#     Construction: 1.0
#     Pattern: 1.6
#
# LRFD4:
#   Dead: 1.2
#   Live:
#     Perm: 1.0
#     Pattern: 1.0
#   Wind: 1.0
#
# Lateral-Envelope:
#   Lateral:
#     Wind: 1.0
#     Seismic: 1.0
#
# The load factors are used in the main.py script to generate load combinations for structural analysis.
